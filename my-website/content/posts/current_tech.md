in the tech world, theres just too much ide/text editors that you can utilize.

when i first started my real SWE job i utilized the cursor IDE a lot to try to play catchup on legacy code i've never seen before.

now that everything at work has slowed down, i've decided to stop using AI as a crutch to do all the heavy lifting for me.

i believe AI can speed up productivity but as a tool and not a crutch (as i've been using it)

it's been very fun diving into the simple technology that can help me improve as a junior developer

examples:
- vim motions (still need the cheat sheet pulled up)
- relearning the CLI commands
