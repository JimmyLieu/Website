i've learned a lot throughout my journey of playing One Piece. i've met a lot of people and created great friendships and will continue to do so.

i have a lot of personal goals to get thru for this game: 
- [x] win locals
- [ ] top 64 in regionals
- [ ] get my first serial


recently I was able to beat JesseB who won the Arlington Regionals in OP06! (shoutout to Jesse)


everyone I played with has taught me something to better improve my gameplay (shoutout to the Grande Line & the sweet 6)

hopefully when i update this post, i will be a much better player and marked something else off this list
